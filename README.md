This repository contains the code that was used for the seminar paper "HAT: Super-Resolution for Satellite Imagery with Hybrid Attention". 
The notebook MainNotebook contains all relevant preprocessing steps. The other files are for completeness and contain useful functions for analysing the output data. 

Unfortunately, the HAT repository could not be added. The relevant modifications to the architecture to include time series are attached below as screenshots:
