This repository contains the code that was used for the seminar paper 'HAT: Super-Resolution for Satellite Imagery with Hybrid Attention'. The notebook MainNotebook contains all relevant preprocessing steps. The other files are for completeness and contain useful functions for analyzing the given satellite imagery dataset.

Unfortunately, the HAT repository could not be added. The relevant modifications to the HAT Architecture to include time series data are attached below as screenshots:
